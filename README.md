This repository contains our efforts to replicate "Mining Frequent Itemsets from Uncertain Data" by C. K. Chui, Ben Kao, and Edward Hung

## Setup

Ensure you're in a unix-like environment, if you're using Windows - use WSL.

- Make setup script executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`
- Run setup script: ./setup

This will create a virtual environment, install all dependencies and create necessary files.

If setup is successful, enter virtual environment:`source venv/bin/activate`

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Navigate to the `src/`directory.
Run `python3 exploratory_data_analysis.py`
